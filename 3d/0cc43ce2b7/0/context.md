# /review - Code Review Workflow

Multi-perspective code review with parallel specialists.

## When to Use

- "Review this code"
- "Review my PR"
- "Check this before I merge"
- "Get feedback on implementation"
- Before merging significant changes
- Quality gates

### Prompt 12

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me trace through the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial deep search**: User asked to read SPEC.md and run a deepsearch against its content and refs, using all MCPs. I read the spec, all source files, shard.yml, llms.txt, researched references via DeepWiki, Firecrawl (Hetzner API, NetBSD autoinstall, ssh2.cr, Admiral, Crinj...

<summary>Agent "Review architecture alignment" completed</summary>
<result>I understand - I'm being blocked from directly reading the hetzner-k3s reference implementation. Let me work with what I have from the spec and detailed research document, which already references key patterns from hetzner-k3s.

Based on the documents I've reviewed, I can provide a comprehensive architecture assessment.

### Prompt 20

actually wait do u think we should do approach a or b

### Prompt 21

ok so continue with  B: Rescue + dd

### Prompt 22

we need https://github.com/spider-gazelle/ssh2.cr as well

### Prompt 23

Install
git clone https://github.com/omarluq/hetzner-blackbsd.git
cd hetzner-blackbsd
shards install
shards build hetzner-blackbsd --release update this to ref make

### Prompt 24

this would still give us disk img and iso no?

### Prompt 25

nop nop! idk why tf would u do such thing! plus why r u assuming versions in the spec! the spec should describe the end state :)
